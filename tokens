programming languages are read by something called a lexer. A lexer is a special type of program that reads patterns of text to make
sense of what you are typing when doing programming. 

identifier 	x, color, UP
keyword 	if, while, return
separator 	}, (, ;
operator 	+, <, =
literal 	true,false, 6.02e23,4,"this is a string"
comment 	/* multiple-line comment */, //single-line comment

Computers only understand 0 and 1. So when we type characters it's only describing how we are going to control the 0 and 1 sequences.
If you were creating your own lexer, you could have changed the tokens how ever you want
